# Notes

origin of all programming languages:

- find an common idiom
- realize languageX poor for that idiom (e.g. functional needs tail recursion optimization)
- extend/replace languageX to amke taht idiom easier

examples

- simple :  
      - while loops
      - subroutines
      - recursion
- more complex : 
      - classes (smalltalk, one prototype, many instantiations)
      - backtracking (prolog, undo decisions while pattern amtching)
      - publish subscribe (elm)
      - parallelism (erlang, exlir)

# DSLs

all these idioms. benefits of variety?

benefits of uniformity: Smalltalk, rule-based programming

- ease of expalnation
- east o using as a target langage
